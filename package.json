  "description": "We have designed a web platform known as FarmConnect to make connection between Farmers <-> Godown Owners. Our project is providing storage accessibility to the farmers by giving information of nearby warehouses to store their crops & connecting Godown Owners directly to the Farmers by eliminating middleman, helping both parties and making process cost efficient. FarmConnect also gives ML- Powered Model in which farmers can get AI recommendation for new storage techniques & practical guidance of different crops. FarmConnect had strengthened the supply chain & enable seamless flow in agricultural storage. For transparency we have also deployed data recording to ICP blockchain which maintains security. FarmConnect is going to give huge positive impact on rural communities at a large scale.",
